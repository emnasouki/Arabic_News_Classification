# Arabic_News_Classification

## Introduction

Welcome to  Arabic news classification project! In this project, we aim to classify Arabic news articles into various categories using natural language processing techniques.

we aim to classify Arabic news articles into various categories using the BERT model, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model.

The BERT model has achieved excellent results on a wide range of NLP tasks, and we believe it has the potential to perform well on the task of Arabic news classification. We have collected a dataset of Arabic news articles and labeled them into various categories, and we will use this dataset to train and evaluate the performance of the BERT model.

We hope that this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in Arabic news classification or natural language processing in general.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PIL 9.1.1
- fastai 1.0.64.dev0
- fastprogress 1.0.3
- matplotlib 3.5.3
- NumPy 1.21.6
- Pandas 1.3.5
- pytorch_pretrained_bert 0.6.2
- PyTorch 1.11.0

## Conclusion

In this project, we have successfully trained and evaluated the performance of the BERT model on the task of Arabic news classification. We have found that the BERT model performs well on this task, achieving high accuracy on the classification of Arabic news articles into various categories.

We have also identified several areas for improvement and potential avenues for future work. For example, we could try fine-tuning the BERT model to further optimize its performance on the classification task, or we could try using different evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. Additionally, we could expand the dataset to include more articles and categories, which could help improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, we believe that this project has demonstrated the potential of the BERT model for Arabic news classification.
